<h1>PygameProject2021</h1>

<p>A python student project developed during my first year of King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang(KMITL) in December 2020.</p>

<br />
<h2> About The Project </h2>
<p>
  My python GUI project is a space shootâ€™em up game, where the main character is controlling a spaceship and has to destroy as many alien ships as possible.
  <br />
  There are 3 different types of alien ships, and the player has 3 lives in the beginning to try and survive. However the player has the chance to pick up 4 different items which will help them fight against the alien ships. These items can increase the number of guns, make the spadceship shoot faster, increase the spaceship's shield, and give an extra life.
  <br />
  Because I developed the game during my first year there is no level or limit to the game, and will only stop once the player has run out of lives. The game also has a highscore system that stores the highest number of points per specific spaceship character. If the player is able to surpass that high score, they replace the old high score.
